# internet_scanner
a simple scanner for the entire interwebs

it uses my library, [hackerman](https://github.com/AgeOfMarcus/hackerman) because im cool

it generates random ip addresses so it doesn't start from somewhere

yup

# other stuff
has some other scripts for fun times

open_sites.py goes through all sites saved to sites.txt 10 by 10 and opens them in firefox for kowalski analasys

yeah
